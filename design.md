The more you understand the problem and practiec these things, the easier this will be.

General.
- What specifically is the problem asking for?
- What information do I need to get the answer, specifically?
- Is there some sort of disgusting brute force solution?
- Is there an ordering or additional information that I can take advantage of to do better than brute force?
- What information can I store to improve runtime (if that is an acceptable tradeoff)?

When making a plan.
- What needs to be passed in between the subfunctions for the problem to be solved?
