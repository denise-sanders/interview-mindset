When given a problem, it's time to ask yourself/your interviewer questions. Things to think about, depending on what is relevant.


## About the input.
- Is there input? 
- What are the data types?
- How much data? A lot of data changes things.
- Do we need to preserve the data or can we destory it?
- Can we count on the input being nonempty, the correct type?
- Can we count on there being a solution with every data set, if the problem asks for a solution?
- Do we assume correct input, or raise exceptions?

## About the output.
- What is the return type/information?

## About the problem, general.
- If it something repeatable, should it be optimized for multiple searches/calls?
- Are we more worried about space/time?
- Is this/what is an example of this problem?
- Make a general rule/case, and ask if it is correct. "Is something is greater than or equal to five, we add it to the system"
