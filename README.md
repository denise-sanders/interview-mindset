# interview-mindset
Because sometimes, you panic

## Philosophy
I do better when I approach things in a systematic way, because I am less likely to forget parts because of being nervous/getting excited by how cool the problem is if there are maps involved/getting tired by end of interview.

Let's say there are three parts to a technical interview.
1. Asking questions, understanding the problem, poking for hints. [questions.md]
2. Designing an answer to a problem, deciding on subfunctions and data structures and how they are connected. [design.md]
3. Programming the answer and testing it, carefully as possible [python3.md]
