I have "relearned" JavaScript a bunch over the years, so here are notes.

# Background

### Philosophy 

  JavaScript is kinda all purpose. Dynamic typing (and duck typing), interpreted language. Used widely on the client side of development, and is popular for server development too. Is object oriented, with prototypes instead of classes. Prototypes are different from classes in ways that are best described here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/816071/prototype-based-vs-class-based-inheritance. It is more flexible, but everytime you copy and object and modify its functions you are creating a new class (free inheritance!).
  
### On the Environment

  ECMAScript is a subset of JavaScript. Basically the original JavaScript (once Mocha, once LiveScript) was renamed ECMAScript at some fancy convention. ECMAScript is like the standard, that JavaScript must execute the same as (I guess there are other versions of ECMAScript, other than JavaScript). A program (that compiles into bytecode) or interpretor that executes JavaScript is called a <strong>JavaScript Engine</strong>. Most browsers (all browsers?) have JavaScript Engines.
